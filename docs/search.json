    "text": "What is BiG?\nThrough evolution, numerous biological organisms have developed smart and sustainable solutions to address challenges posed by changes of biological diversity, population, energy source and the environment at large. Nature, especially the biosphere, can thus serve as a source of inspirations for mankind, who is facing similar challenges. With critical needs for sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems, civil engineers have central roles to play in bio- inspired research. Treating soil as living systems, the backbone of my research lies in advancing knowledge of the fundamental behaviors of soil affected by living organisms (e.g., bacteria, plants, burrowing animals) involving multi-physics processes at multiple scales. The new knowledge is then applied to develop next-generation geotechnics."

We mainly use Python, Matlab and C++ for computing; we open-source libraries for robotic control; we strive to practice reproducible research by using documenting and publishing tools such as Rmarkdown and Quarto. We love tinkering around with open-source software and hardware; and we would love to share our findings and tools with others."
