We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.\nWe are part of the Center for Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG) and the Geotechnical Engineering Group in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment (SSEBE) at Arizona State University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe study animals\n\n\n\n\n\nWe design robots\n\n\n\n\n\nWe model granular materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\nNews"
