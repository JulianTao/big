    "text": "Anything else here?\n<++>\nBurrowing organisms can inhabit a wide range of subsurface soil types, and adopt a variety of burrowing strategies such as fracturing, digging, bulk fluidization, localized fluidization, localized grain rearrangement and compaction, facilitated by rhythmically changing their body shape. Several different species such as earthworms and bivalve mollusks possess extraordinary burrowing efficiency compared to most man-made penetrometers. Why the dynamic change in body shape is able to facilitate penetration in particulate soil is still largely unknown. From a geomechanical perspective, this award supports the discovery and fundamental understanding of the interaction between soil and bio-inspired penetrators with dynamic shapes. This research has potential to inspire the development of next-generation, high-efficiency underground construction technologies and versatile small-scale underground penetrometers.\nDistributed sensing is essential for realizing intelligent assessment or management of the natural and built environment based on rich spatial and temporal data. A wireless sensing network (WSN) is particularly attractive since it eliminates costly and cumbersome wire connections. However, there are tremendous challenges involved in the application of WSN in harsh environments such as the near-surface underground region, mainly due to the fact that soil is opaque, heterogeneous, dissipative and hard to penetrate/excavate. This EAGER project explores a bioinspired platform technology known as active self-boring robots, which will enable next generation dynamic underground WSN (DUWSN)."

Nature, especially the biosphere, can thus serve as a source of inspirations for mankind, who is facing similar challenges. With critical needs for sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems, civil engineers have central roles to play in bio-inspired research.\nTreating soil as living systems, the backbone of our research lies in advancing knowledge of the fundamental behaviors of soil in interaction with living organisms (e.g., bacteria, plants, burrowing animals) involving multi-physics processes at multiple scales. The new knowledge is then applied to develop next-generation geotechnics."
