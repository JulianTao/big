Nature, especially the biosphere, can thus serve as a source of inspirations for mankind, who is facing similar challenges. With critical needs for sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems, civil engineers have central roles to play in bio-inspired research.\nTreating soil as living systems, the backbone of our research lies in advancing knowledge of the fundamental behaviors of soil in interaction with living organisms (e.g., bacteria, plants, burrowing animals) involving multi-physics processes at multiple scales. The new knowledge is then applied to develop next-generation geotechnics."
